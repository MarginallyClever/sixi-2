# Sixi 2 Robot Arm

Sixi 2 is an open source industrial robot arm.  It is designed with six degrees of freedom and can hold 2kg at 80cm.

## Motivation

3D printers can print parts for themselves, but they cannot self-assemble.  The long goal of the Sixi is to build a machine that can assemble copies of itself.

When 3D printers were closed source, they started at $10k.  Makerbot and Prusa changed the game by bringing high quality open source 3D printers down to $2k.  Marginally Clever Robots, Ltd. aims to be the Prusa of robot arms.

## Ease

The Sixi has no glue because we like operations that can be undone.

All the 3D printable parts were produced on a Prusa MK2s at default settings (20% infill, 200um layer height).  Parts are carefully designed to have a minimum of support material cleaning.

There is one part turned on a lathe.  Unavoidable.

## Links and Info

Sixi was designed in Fusion 360.  The design is publicly shared...

Marginally Clever uses our home made Robot Overlord app to simulate, drive, and test the Sixi robot arm.

Marginally Clever uses Makelangelo Firmware in the Arduino compatible brain of the robot.
